# <p align="center" style="margin-top: 0px;"> Human Body Detection and Face Recoginion
  


The human detection feature is a feature that is used as a parameter in the process of dropping goods in the “Drone Delivery” system. Human detection is a method in image processing that focuses on detecting objects in the form of the human body. The object in the form of a human body in this study is the object of the recipient of the goods to be addressed by the system using the Histogram of Oriented Gradients algorithm. When the system has brought the goods to be sent, the system will go down to carry out the process of placing the goods by using the system’s success parameters in detecting the object. A system that successfully detects objects where the human body is, will send the items that have been brought to the object of the recipient that has been detected. However, when the system fails to detect human presence around the system, the system will return to the starting point of departure. The result of this research is a system that successfully detects the presence of humans as objects receiving goods in real-time and provides a signal to the system for the system to go down in the process of placing the goods that have been carried by the system. Thus, the system can perform the packet drop process well when the system can detect objects in real-time with good accuracy up to a distance of 8 meters.
